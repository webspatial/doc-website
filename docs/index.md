# WebSpatial Handbook

## Overview

Itâ€™s recommended to read these docs in order, especially the first three chapters:

1. [**Introduction**](introduction): Introduces the problems WebSpatial solves and the benefits it brings.
2. [**Quick Example**](quick-start): Use a minimal example to get a quick feel for the actual results and development experience of the WebSpatial SDK.
3. [**Core Concepts**](core-concepts): Learn the fundamental concepts of [Spatial Apps](core-concepts/shared-space-and-spatial-apps) and the [WebSpatial SDK](core-concepts/unique-concepts-in-webspatial).

The fourth chapter provides comprehensive and detailed [**Development Guide**](development-guide). The guide consists of three parts, structured for both sequential reading and quick reference:

1. [What web projects can use WebSpatial API](development-guide/web-projects-that-support-webspatial).
2. How to [add the WebSpatial SDK](development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects) to your web projects, [use WebSpatial Builder for visionOS testing](development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-2-add-build-tool-for-packaged-webspatial-apps) (simulator or device), and how to bring spatial features to your site while still [keeping it a standard, cross-platform website](development-guide/enabling-webspatial-in-web-projects/step-3-integrate-webspatial-sdk-into-web-build-tools).
3. How to [use the WebSpatial API](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api) ([Spatialization](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api/spatialize-html-elements), [Material](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api/add-material-backgrounds), [Elevation](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api/elevate-2d-elements), [Scenes](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api/manage-multiple-scenes), [3D](development-guide/using-the-webspatial-api/add-3d-content)) in web projects where the SDK is already integrated.

There are currently two sample projects:

1. One is the [Quick Example](quick-start) itself, which you can build it from scratch, or just grab the ready-made version from [the repo](https://github.com/webspatial/quick-example). There's also a [video](https://youtu.be/ddBBDBq7nhs) showing the full setup process.
2. The other is the ["techshop" demo](https://github.com/webspatial/sample-techshop), showcases more realistic spatial UI design and also demonstrates [cross-platform functionality](introduction/built-on-the-existing-web-ecosystem#example-techshop).

## Feedback & Support

<!-- :::warning -->

The WebSpatial SDK is newly open-sourced and may have bugs or missing docs/examples. If you run into issues, don't spend too much time trying to fix them yourself, just share sample code with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nhFhSuhNF2) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/webspatial/webspatial-sdk/issues). That way, we can quickly assess the problem and offer a solution, suggestion, or hotfix.
